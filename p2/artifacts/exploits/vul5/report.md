### Missing Account Access Coltrol
- Category: Access Control Vulnerability
- Root Cause: In `user.php`, any account's information can be displayed by changing the ID in the HTTP request (in the URL), thereby revealing that account's password to anyone. 
- Fix: The password should not be displayed at all, because this requires storing it in plaintext, which is unsafe. For storing the password hash, the page should ensure that the only user who can read the hash is the user that is signed in.
