### Weak Password Security
- Category: Password security vulnerability
- Root Cause: There are no strength checks on the passwords. This means that users can make weak passwords which could easily be guessed or brute forced. Additionally, passwords are stored as plaintext in the database so in the event of a database leak all security is lost.
- Fix: When a user is registering, enforce restraints on what passwords are allowed. For instance, I enforced that passwords must be at least 8 characters and contain an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number. Additionally, I used `password_hash()` to hash passwords with salt with bcrypt before they are stored in the database, then `password_verify()` to verify the password a user provides when they login. This provides more security for users, and the system as a whole.
