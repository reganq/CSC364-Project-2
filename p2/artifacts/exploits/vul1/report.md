### SQL Injection Login
- Category: SQL injection attack
- Root Cause: In `login.php`, arguments from the username/password boxes are passed as strings to the SQL input without validation. This allows an attacker to inject other SQL code into the input and login without a pasdword. This vulnerability also occurs in `register.php`, `search.php`, and `user.php`.
- Fix: PHP's data object API allows us to prepare an SQL statement, then provide the statement values to validate and execute with. This prevents the user from executing arbitrary SQL statements.
