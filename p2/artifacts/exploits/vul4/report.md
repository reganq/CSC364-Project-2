### Aribtrary File Reading
- Category: Unchecked input vulnerability.
- Root Cause: In `archive.php`, a user can input a base 64-encoded string which should decode into a path to a file, that is then read and displayed back to the user. The problem is, the filepath can be arbitrary (for example, the filepath can contain `..`). This allows a malicious user to read any file in the project directory, including the source code.
- Fix: The filename should be validated to prevent malicious inputs. In particular, it should be verified that there is no way to enter another folder. That is, the filename should not include any `/`'s.
