### Ping shell injection attack
- Category: Shell injection attack.
- Root Cause: In `ping.php`, some dangerous shell characters are checked for, but not enough. With a clever statement, an attacker can execute an arbitrary number of commands in the shell (as demonstrated by the images in evidence).
- Fix: The PHP method `escapeshellarg()` can be used to escape any dangerous characters to prevent an arbitrary number of arguments being passed to `shell_exec()`.
